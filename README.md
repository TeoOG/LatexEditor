# LatexEditor
LatexEditor in Java (Eclipse Project), made for Software Development course, of the University of Ioannina, using the MVC design pattern.

Latex is a well known high quality document preparation markup language.
It provides a large variety of styles and commands that enable advanced document formatting.

The objective of this project is to develop a simple Latex editor for inexperienced Latex users. It provides 
templates such as article, book, letter, report and saving option.
The goal of the editor is to facilitate the usage of Latex commands for the preparation of Latex documents. 

Implemented using Java Swing for GUI and JUnit for testing.
Because this is an old eclipse project I made for my uniiversity course, in order to run it on IntelliJ, 
go to File → New → Project from Existing Sources and cliick or .classpath or .project. If you're having trouble
running the project, open a terminal and go the ```/src``` path of the project. 

Then, in order to compile it and run it , use ```javac view/View.java model/*.java``` and ```java view.View``` .
