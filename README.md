Latex is a well known high quality document preparation markup language.
It provides a large variety of styles and commands that enable advanced document formatting.

The goal of the editor is to facilitate the usage of Latex commands for the preparation of Latex documents. 
One of the prominent features that distinguishes the LatexEditor from other similar applications is its multi-strategy version tracking functionalities
